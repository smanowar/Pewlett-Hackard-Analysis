# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview 

### Purpose
As many current employees at Pewlett-Hackard are reaching retirement age, the purpose of this analysis is to determine the number of employees expected to retire, as well to create solutions to soften the impact of the impeding 'silver tsumani'. One such solution proposed is an employee mentorship program where employees that are elegible for retirement can drop to part-time status and mentor the new employees instead of retiring, thus softening the impact of a large retirement at once.  

Taking employee data from the csv files -.csv, -.csv, and -.csv, using SQL and PgAdmin we will determine the number of total employees elegible for retirement by their job title, as well as the number of employees elegible for a potential mentorship program, which will be outlined in the Results section below.


## Results 
Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

### Total Figure of Employees Eligible for Retirement

Firstly, the number of retiring employees was calculated by their job title (fill in.csv). This was done by merging the csv files x, y, and z, and filtering them on the constraint "employees born between x and y"

### Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program
One possible solution for the impending increase in employees retireing at PH is to introduct a mentorship program in which retired employees can then train the next generation of PW. Eligibility for the mentorship program was calculated based on the following criteria:

A total listing of employees elegible for the mentorship program have been determined and listed in (fill in.csv)


## Summary
Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

**_How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?_**

The "silver tsunami" is defined as, "a metaphor, used to describe the expected increase in the senior population" (definition cited from:https://www.leisurecare.com/resources/silver-tsunami-senior-living/) 
From our merged csv (fill in), we can see that the number of roles that will need to be filled as the silver tsumani makes an impact is (fill in).
This number varies by job title, as seen in the chart below:

**_Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?_**
